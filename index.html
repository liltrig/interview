    <h3>Why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
    <p>Art has always been my passion, so I decided to make a career out of it. I love to create for other people and put my pieces on display for the public eye. I would love to help small companies and people create identities for their businesses. Not only will I be making my dreams come true, but theirs as well.</p>

    <h3>What makes you nervous about becoming a designer?</h3>
    <p>Encountering people that don’t understand my style and the messages I try to portray is my biggest fear. Some people don’t click in that quickly, and sometimes I like to make things challenging for the viewer, to make them think outside the box. If someone can’t see what I’m trying to throw out there, then I feel like a failure.</p>

    <h3>What excites you about design?</h3>
    <p>Being able to explore new topics and ideas, as well as learning new techniques to further improve my ability to create new things. I love to experiment and push myself out of my comfort zone when it comes to new ideas. I’m never afraid of trial and error. Also, the gratitude that comes from a job well done is endearing.</p>

    <h3>What are your strengths? What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h3>
    <p>I’m very good at exploring new ideas; taking one thing and turning it into something else. Experimentation is key. I’m very keen with fine detail as well. The main thing I struggle with is keeping a consistent style. While it’s good to keep trying new things, developing a signature style is something I haven’t grasped yet. A certain style will help make my work more well known, but I still have yet to develop one.</p>

    <h3>What aspect of graphic design to you enjoy most?</h3>
    <p>Mostly, I enjoy messing around with colours and composition to draw different emotions from the viewer. I can either create a contrast of emotions between both aspects, or tie them together to make one whole feeling. It’s great to see how many different directions you can take from colour alone. Adding composition is a complete game changer.

    <h3>What roles/responsibilities does a graphic designer portray in society?</h3>
    <p>A designer is responsible for making representation. Whether it be through advertisements, business cards, and even logos. Designers help create an identity for brands and people, and even themselves. Designers are the creators of the world, constantly creating for the public eye. We challenge viewers to think thoroughly to see the embedded messages. Overall, designers help the world remain a beautiful place.

    <h3>Describe your best work environment.</h3>
    <p>Personally, I like to keep myself away from home, and be somewhere that I won’t be distracted. I happen to get a lot of work done at school, and even find myself spending extra time there to get things done. I find that it’s better for me to focus with music. Music helps create emotion that can easily be put into whatever piece I’m working on.

    <h3>What inspires you the most?</h3>
    <p>A lot of my inspiration comes from the work around me. Seeing different ideas surrounding me makes me wonder how I can take the idea and display it in a different aspect. I take it as more of a challenge.

    <h3>What is a website?</h3>
    <p>A website is a platform that allows people all around the world to connect. It’s a place to share our lives through photos, text, and art. A website isn’t just a way of communicating with friends, it’s also a way to reach out for business, find work, and overall, they make life easier. </p>

    <h3>What are your stands on feedback? How can you push your skills further?</h3>
    <p>Feedback keeps me going, and helps push my ideas further. I like to know what people think about my work. I’m not really sensitive about it, since I often feel that my work is never always perfect. It can always use improvement. To hear other people’s ideas on how to make it better always helps me as an aspiring designer. By finding a more distinct style that I can use, I will be able to further improve my skills.</p>
